The Yaml File is divided into multiple parts.

First Part = Info:
- This category provides a brief description of the API, version we would like to use, the title of our API, contact information
and a license.
Question(s):
1. What does it mean by version?

Second Part = Paths:
- We first come up with a path for the current API we're writing, so we know how to access it.
- Within the paths section, we have a post section through which we get to define the input/output (tells us what is expected
of client and server).
- We have a summary section which summarizes our goal, in this case we take a picture of the boggle board, send it to the server,
and it returns a list of boggle Words.
- We have an operation ID (we name the function) and we produce a json file (json is a language used to communicate between
client and server)
- We define the parameter for the input which is a 2d array boggleBoard.
- We define the responses section with a description of the output and type of output we are expecting (array).

Question(s):
1. How did you come up with the schema references?
2. What does the 200/400 (Line 29 and 35) integers signify in the responses section?

Third Part = Definitions:
- We define the input and output. The BoggleWord is an object of type string because it a list of string that we are returning.
 The BoggleBoard is an an array of 5 arrays of type string.

Question(s):
1. After we wrote the (type:) on line 39, what does properties and word mean?
2. After we wrote the (type:) on line 44, what does the items mean?
