## Boggle Solver Application
An application that solves the Boggle word-finding game by taking in a picture of a Boggle Board and returning a list of word solutions. 

## Motivation
When looking up Boggle Solver websites, users had to manually enter each letter of the Boggle Board online, which was extremely time-consuming. To optimize the process, I created an application where users can take a picture of their Boggle Board and upload it to the application. 

## Technologies Used
Built with Java, React, Ant Design, JavaScript, and Swagger Open API. 

## How it Works
